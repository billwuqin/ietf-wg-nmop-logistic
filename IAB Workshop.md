IAB workshop on the Next Era of Network Management Operations (NEMOPSWS)

# Introduction

The IAB organized a workshop in June 2002 to establish a
dialog between network operators and protocol developers, and to guide
IETF when working on network management protocols. The
outcome of that workshop was documented in the "Overview of the 2002 IAB Network Management 
Workshop" [RFC3535] which identified 14 operators requirements for consideration 
in future network management protocol design and related data models, along with some 
recommendations for the IETF organization.

Those requirements were instrumental in developing first the NETCONF
protocol (in the NETCONF Working Group) [RFC6241], the associated YANG
data modeling language (in the NETMOD Working Group) [RFC7950], 
RESTCONF [RFC8040], and most recently CORECONF.

More than 20 years later, it is time to evaluate what has been achieved since
then. This new workshop aims to discuss the following key topics:

- Recap the historical results since the 2002 workshop (current deployments,
  state of the art) and identify the operational barriers to making these
  technologies widely implemented (limitations, hurdles).

- Sketch new requirements for future network management operations, in a
  collective manner with the industry. A plan of action, including
  recommendations for the IETF organization, is welcome.

# Review of the 2002 Workshop Outcomes

The IAB NEMOPS workshop will provide an assessment of the RFC3535 requirements
in terms of specifications completeness. Also, this workshop will assess to what
extent the RFC3535 recommendations were driving network management efforts
within the IETF and influencing other Standards Development Organizations' (SDOs) activities. 

Regarding operator deployments, the following items will be discussed (non-exhaustive list):

- What do implementations and deployments look like today?

- If there are any issues experienced during implementation, what are they?

- Do operators deploy designs that are based upon IETF network management standards?

- If not, do operators think that further specifications that would document key features
  or requirements should be worked on and published (possibly by the IETF)? 

- Are there any alternate solutions that better fit the operators' needs
  than those that exist today (including those that rely upon IETF standards)? 

# Laying a path for the future of Network Management

Network topologies have become significantly more complex since the
2002 IAB workshop, as have the router and host technologies. 
Assuming this trend will continue, this workshop's ambition is
to lay a new directional foundation for the continued
future of network management protocols, gathering new input on 
what new issues network operators and network management implementers are facing.

The candidate items for discussion are as follows (non-exhaustive list):

- Tooling, opensource, experimentation, system integration

- Data observability (Data & Knowledge)

- Integration issues with the business layer

- Automation, orchestration, and autonomy 

Recommendations that may come out of this effort should be helpful 
to the global industry, including the IETF, the IRTF, as well as
implementers, operational groups, and other entities.

# Out of scope topics

A workshop dedicated to management techniques related to encrypted
networks have already been held [RFC9490]; these topics are therefore out of
scope for this workshop.

# Outreach and Timeline

In 2002, many network operators attended IETF meetings and
participated in network management protocol discussions. Direct
participation of network operators has since dwindled, with many
operators focusing on conferences that are more central to their
needs -- these include RIPE, NANOG, APRICOT, AutoConn, etc.

Under this effort, we expect to stimulate an outreach effort to
attract opinions and interest by visiting these other venues and running 
virtual sessions. This series of outreaches will be concluded by a final
virtual session, tentatively organized in December 2024, where we will
summarize the findings. 

Until the conclusion session draws close, the mailing list will be
used for interim participation/BoFs at other conferences, general
announcements, and any related discussions.
