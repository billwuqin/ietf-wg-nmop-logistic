IAB workshop on the Next Era of Network Management Operations (NEMOPS)

# Introduction

The IAB organized a workshop in June 2002 to establish a
dialog between network operators and protocol developers, and to guide
IETF when working on network management protocols. The
outcome of that workshop was documented in the "IAB Network Management
Workshop" [RFC3535] which identified 14 operators requirements for consideration 
in future network management protocol design and related data models, along with some 
recommendations for the IETF organization.

Those requirements were instrumental for developing first the NETCONF
protocol (in the NETCONF Working Group) [RFC6241], the associated YANG
data modeling language (in the NETMOD Working Group) [RFC7950], 
RESTCONF [RFC8040], and most recently CORECONF.

More than 20 years later, it is time to evaluate what has been achieved since
then. This new workshop aims at discussing the following key topics:

- Recap the historical results since the 2002 workshop (current deployments,
  state of the art) and identify the operational barriers for making these
  technologies widely implemented (limitations, hurdles).

- Sketch new requirements for future network management operations, in a
  collective manner with the industry. A plan of action, including
  recommendations for the IETF organization, is welcome.

# Review of the 2002 Workshop Outcomes

The NEMOPS IAB workshop will provide an assessment of the RFC3535 requirements
in terms of specifications completeness. Also this workshop will assess to what
extent the RFC3535 recommendations were driving network management efforts
within the IETF and influence other Standards Development Organizations (SDOs)activities. 

Regarding operator deployments, the following items will be discussed (non exhaustive list):

- What do implementations and deployments look like today?

- What issues did operators encounter during implementation?

- What IETF network management standards are operators deploying today?

- How are existing IETF network management standards insufficient for operators' needs?

- What additional features or requirements do operators feel need to be standardized (possibly by the IETF)?

- What alternative (i.e., non-IETF) solutions are being deployed that better
  fit operators' needs?

# Laying a path for the future of Network Management

Network topologies have become significantly more complex since the
2002 IAB workshop, as have the router and host technologies. 
Assuming this trend will only be continuing, this workshop ambitions 
to lay a new directional foundation for the continued
future of network management protocols, gathering new input on 
what new issues network operators and network management implementers are facing.

The candidate items for discussion are as follows (non exhaustive list):

- Tooling, opensource, experimentation, system integration

- Data observability (Data & Knowledge)

- Integration issues with business layer

- Automation, orchestration, and autonomy 

Recommendations that may come out of this effort should be helpful 
to the global industry, including the IETF, the IRTF, as well as
implementers, operational groups, and other entities.

# Out of scope topics

A workshop dedicated to management techniques related to encrypted
networks has already been held [RFC9490]; these topics are therefore out of
scope for this workshop.

# Outreach and Timeline

In 2002, many network operators attended IETF meetings and
participated in network management protocol discussions. Direct
participation of network operators have since dwindled, with many
operators focusing on conferences that are more central to their
needs -- these include RIPE, NANOG, AutoConn, etc.

Under this effort we expect to stimulate an outreach effort to
attract opinions and interest by visiting these other venues and by running 
virtual sessions. This series of outreaches will be concluded by a final
virtual session, tentatively organized in December 2024, where we will
summarize the findings. 

Until the conclusion session draws close, the mailing list will be
used for interim participation/BoFs at other conferences, general
announcements, and any related discussions.
